## Code for the [GY-521](https://protosupplies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MPU-6050-GY-521-Accelerometer-Schematic-1.jpg) gyro module. 

You can find a useful tutorial [here](https://electrosome.com/interfacing-mpu-6050-gy-521-arduino-uno/). This might not be on the final design as the arduino nano BLE has a builtin gyro module.
