# UChicago Robotics Micromouse

All of the information here concerns the wiring and programming for the micromouse bot. The project is split into resources for programming and resources for PCB design.

## ArduinoDemos
This consists of the components we will use on the mms bot (IR sensors, motorcontrollers, etc). Feel free to reference it when designing PCBs and programming the mouse.

## Core
This contains all the code for the micromouse. It's mostly written in C++ and is compilied onto the Microcontroller with [ProjectIO](https://docs.platformio.org)
